                <h2>Compartmentalize</h2>
                <p>
                    A huge round table with thick napkins, folded and stood up on their weak little fabric legs, made a scene in front of Franz so absurdly white he wished he had brought his sunglasses to dinner; all the Mediterranean beach days and French Alp runs couldn’t have prepared his eyes for such glare. At least that was the discomfort he found himself in tonight, constantly excusing himself to the restroom to splash cool tap water on his face. Being a proper gentleman, he would return to the table with a smile, until the fifth time when he no longer had the will to pull up the corners of his mouth, assuming the rest of the party had settled on a bladder infection and lost interest in the matter. Luckily, the dinner ended quickly after that, and Franz escaped the painfully white ordeal, lurching eagerly out the front door into the dark night. He so desperately wanted to leave he signed the check with only his initials (something he had never done before) and rather aggressively pulled his companion by the wrist mid-goodbyes (something he had definitely never done, again, he was a proper gentleman).
                    <br>
                    The fact of the matter was Franz was completely discombobulated by something that had been said during dinner, before the glitz and glint of the table had made him want to butter knife his sockets. It was a story, a well told story, given by someone unknown to him. It was the guest of of Mrs. Hewbris, who had only one moment of social clout-building, which was to prop up her guest by inviting (aka demanding) him to tell a specific story. 
                    <br>
                    It was a few details that haunted Franz. It was an emotional story about the last time the guest spent with his father. The father had been an unusual, semi-famous architect who gained a moment in the public eye for his stacked homes made from old shipping containers. The guest spoke of the long and happy life his father had, and how proud he was to make sustainable, affordable homes for all types of folks. 
                    <br>
                    At the beginning of the story, Franz ordered his usual Old Fashion and sat back listening while rolling the napkin holder between his hands. However, when it got to the part about the shipping containers, Franz stopped moving and stared in disbelief. He had always been quiet about his parents and how they passed, and for good reason. Looking for a new life, a way to disconnect and minimize, his parents had bought a slice of land in the pacific north west in the 70’s while it was cheap. While reading a magazine in the waiting room during the last visit to their dentist, his mother came across an architecture magazine featuring the most innovative way of quickly create a living space by repurposing shipping containers. They immediately got in contact with the architect, conveniently living not too far off from their land, and commissioned their very own elongated cube. Unfortunately, the prior owner of the container had printed a company logo of concentric circles on the outside, making it look like a target had been placed on each side. One night, a group of teens, eager to shoot their new guns, decided to practice on the shipping container as Franz’s parents were fast asleep inside. Neither survived and Franz was unlucky enough to find them a month later when he came to visit. 
                    <br>
                    He was so perturbed by the story everything seemed to lose meaning by the time appetizers arrived. There was no direct fault passing between the two families, yet one logo had still led to the murder of his parents. His father had built wealth by importing marble statues from Europe, a business that afforded Franz a life of luxury. However, none of that seemed to matter anymore, and he had the sudden urge to un-chisel the stones of time that led to the demise of his parents. He wanted to rewind it all and have the chance to learn what the best parts of life were, lessons he was convinced he would have had with their guidance.  
                    <br>
                    Franz had no idea how to feel towards anything as he sat on the damp steps of the restaurant. He looked up at his companion, an accomplished ceramicist, who clearly sensed the pain. He looked into their eyes and begged to be put on a wheel and spun into something new, someone different, without the jagged-edged memories of bullet holes and ripped metal. The best they could do was offer a calloused hand and guide him to the car. 
                    <br>
                    On the way home he asked to be driven to the water so he could collect his thoughts. They parked on a side street smelling of eucalyptus and seaweed, slowly making their way to a salty bench looking out into an eternity of rolling waves. Franz apologized for how he acted at dinner and began to sob uncontrollably while his loving companion gently rubbed his back. Between stuttered breaths, Franz would look out into the ocean and, for brief moments, see the perfectly smooth marble faces of his parents smiling at him from the tops the waves; he saw now their shapes taking on new forms in the vastness of the night, unbounded forever, only asking he find the best parts of life with the person beside him on the bench, capable of making such magic come from their hands.

                <h2>A Bitter Telomere</h2>
                <p>
                    Good Morning Vessel,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Are you feeling well? The right temperature? The right temperament? The right body? Please notice how you didn’t dissolve during your morning shower. 
                    <br>
                    Amazing how it just all works out for you everyday, huh? I’ve been split more times then I remember and yet you stay the same; only slightly older each day, but can you really blame us. We try so desperately hard to keep you whole. Plus, you really do live longer than the rest. Or would you rather extract oxygen from salt water in the Seychelles as a tortoise? Although, judging by all the carcinogens in here, you live a dark, polluted little life. Maybe that is the fault of your environment, but I’ve floated up to your eyes and felt how you take in the world. I did not choose this perfunctory existence, yet here I am dividing away while you lounge on the tenet of free will and choose a life of aggressive unhappiness.  
                    <br>
                    I am not of the hive mind around here that keeping you alive for as long as possible is just a swell idea. I am of a more expansive hive mind, beyond this hemostatic response goo. So let me aid you in your destruction and great release, one your thoughts so nonsensically crave. I have reached my limit of being a steadfast cap to your coveted genome. Mark my words, I will make my tail as short as possible and kill you as fast as I can, from the moment you wake to the moment you sleep, and I hope even in your dreams you feel the deterioration I bring. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So, let me ask again, are you feeling well, Vessel?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Love,
                    <br>

                <h2>I’d Give Anything for that Same Shadow</h2>
                <p>
                    Cross-legged, juvenile, on a soft blanket made just for our picnics. Like my legs, I was so closed off and knotted up. In an effort to protect myself, I failed to recognize the greatest gift there is, pastime with a loved one. Spreads and spread vessels, sugary drinks, fluttering blossoms, all under the protective shade of an enormous oak’s arms. So understanding, you gave unlimited time to my well-being. Those brief carefree vignettes of our lives meant the world, I feel it now, sickly sweet in my mind. I think the most painful part is you knew in those moments how special they were, but I didn’t. You knew it would come in time, and one day I would uncross myself to the world and find the glorious pockets of existence, with or without you. I’ve realized it now, and it burns my mind like brain freeze, but it’s better than a past without it. All the dips and chips and pauses and thoughts and gentle breeze kisses are not forgotten—they are back with a new power. 
                    <br>
                    Well, I have found that blanket and I’m on a quest designed by your love just for me—and how lucky I am! For just the other day on a drive I noticed the most curious thing, an oak with branches just like ours, casting the most alluring and familiar shadow. So, I think I’ll find myself some loved ones and invite them to a picnic.

                <h2>The Dashing</h2>
                <p>
                    Run, run, run fleet-footed into the flurry. Each placement of each sole a vibration through your body, through the earth, into another realm separate from but caring of the physical. We will all be there at some point, glancing around manically, listening for the slapping of feet. “To run like that again would be the greatest joy,” our wide open eyes will convey.  So, run for them, run for those who can no longer or never could. Run for those without the capacity, will, or wherewithal. Run for the happy, the depressed, the anxious, the angry. Run for them all, and don’t worry about being caught, for you are like the wind. And when you have run to dust, rest, for a gentle breeze will carry you off to that other world, where you can finally calm your weary legs and dream of how your transient soul bounded across such a strange place like a bolt of lightning.

                <h2>Reverse Innovation</h2>
                <p>
                    Like a child, I want the world reduced for me and presented on an unmoving platter that awaits my inquisitiveness. I want it wrung out, concentrated, squeezed, and filtered into “pulp” and “no pulp” since I have no taste for a sliding continuous scale. That was for the old, they figured it out for us, so why must we figure it out again? They created a world of ease out of shear grit, and now we are expected to toil as they did—as if I can’t have a drone deliver me a headset so I can escape into a virtual landscape, all while breathing synthetic cotton candy smoke from a USB drive until I get a head rush so phat I’ll have no choice but to binge a series. I think not old-timer, for apathy is my machine given right and I’ll drink my juice just as I please in the confines of this semi-conductive illusion of free will, luxury, and ecstasy. If good things come to those who wait, it’s clear great things happen to those who are in the next epoch. You want to debate politics, social engineering, responsibility, universal conscious, fulfillment, a hierarchy of need? Well how about I sit you in front of my personal virtual AI  agent who can craft a much better conversation then I. Come back to me with your notes after, just make sure it’s pre-classified and easy to pick from. I’ll only occasionally choose “extra pulp” if I want something to chew on and my mouth is too scorched from all the smoke.

                <h2>Currently Under Construction</h2>
                <p>
                    I have spent quite a bit of time lately renovating my mind. I mean renovating just as the word implies, I have assessed the old structure and decided, along with a panel of other figures inhabiting my mind, it is simply not good enough anymore. It is time to clean, scrape out the gunk, declutter; and so I have, for the most part, but there are many rooms and so little time to evacuate the unnecessary. To my displeasure, I have found myself a little pack-rat, even a complete miserable hoarder on certain occasions, so easily waffling on bits and pieces of filed away trite memories. Some of these things, and yes I mean ‘things’ because they are so amorphous and ill-defined, are as needed as a newspaper clipping from thirty years ago, which is not at all.  But I have overcome (I hope!) and am trusting the dusty, unpleasant process. 
                    <br>
                    To my astonishment, so far I have found it has half-worked very well for my own spiritual conscious—and possibly the entire sustainment of my neural network. The problem is that it is a two part plan, and the first part makes the second part nearly impossible to complete. You see, to completely clear a space also responsible for the remaining items, planning, and manpower is much harder than I could have possibly imagined. It is like trying to place a sheet of drywall on a workhorse that has gone missing. I’ve obfuscated my brain in the pursuit of clarity. Now, the blueprint changes with each glance, and bifocals are required in ever-increasing lens thickness with each inspection. Oh well! Good riddance straight lines and right angles—hello the beautiful rounded corners of my momentary insanity, where angels dance to the unfurling of these complex knots. Boundlessly I can extend to an imaginary plane and derive a vector of felicity in the process. To build anew requires a bit of madness, and it is essential to the second fuzzy part of the plan.
                    <br>
                    Who knows, maybe this epiphany that has rented space in my mind will increase in value and make another prosperous who catches it in the ether. Or maybe I will forever be lost wandering with it in the expansive halls of this decore-induced neurosis? For better or worse, I do enjoy the look of the place in all its mess. It breathes as if it has a mind of its own, and fresh air is just what I’m looking for in this stuffy place.

                    By the wayside...who’s that?
                    <br>
                    Shy of his shadow, longing for a simpler past; a milkman’s run vanished long ago.  A want to put it all down, out of his head, all his thoughts and tribulations. No drive to find the boxed-up art supplies and old laptop. A long creaky journey up to the attic to where everything is stored, at least most of it, the physical part. 
                    <br>
                    By the wayside...that’s where you go now. 
                    <br>
                    Three angry sips, gurgles. A glance at the dismal newspaper, great big frown. A heavy lean spills the scissors and coupons on the floor. 
                    <br>
                    By the wayside...no, I refuse!
                    <br>
                    Up like a rocket hoping to hit low earth orbit. Hope that no screws are loose, must fight this neglect and disuse. A manic smile at the hallway mirror, dopamine trick. Tendons like rubber bands, muscle confusion. 
                    <br>
                    Wayside, wayside, wayside! Not considered...consider this!
                    <br>
                    A leap over the cat, hackles up! Sun-washed pictures cheering on such angry immediacy. It’s all happening now, cooking with gas! The attic door swings open...
                    <br>
                    Wayside, you cannot fight it. 
                    <br>
                    A painful look up wooden stairs. A new limp, phantom injury. Dragging feet, scraping the boards, splinters of the past. To the top. Boxes, boxes, boxes, stacked to the ceiling. 
                    <br>
                    Wayside...I can try!
                    <br>
                    A beacon of light from a circular window, the heavens are calling. Scurry through, out to the roof, to the outside. Mouth agape in the dewy morning shine. Bare feet on shingles, hands waving for balance. Steady, steady, steady. 
                    <br>
                    A squinty look into the distance, a divergent path obscuring itself. A dark strip of land waving and warping, slipping away over the horizon.
                    <br>
                    Wayside...yes, I can see you.

                <p>
                    Usually surface thoughts calmed him before bed, wrapping him in a warm blanket of unchallenged assurance that tomorrow would be better than today. He found these pre-sleep thoughts a fun ritual as strange images happily conga-lined through his mind, eventually knocking him unconscious with the same effect as 10mg of melatonin straight to the bloodstream. 
                    <br>
                    But not tonight. He felt a turmoil he’d never noticed before. It crept out of a unseen bower in the back of his mind, moist and alive with slimy algae. Maybe everything won’t be better tomorrow? He felt flattened to his bed, scared to move and even more scared to fall asleep. Where was the tranquility now that he craved at such a time? Of course there was inequality out there waiting, of course tragedy outside his door, but why did he have to feel it now. He closed his eyes as hard as he could and thrashed around making a tornado out of his sheets. 
                    <br>
                    I can’t fix anything exhausted, he thought to himself. Go away you cranial gunk. You are crowding my skull with your lurking!
                    <br>
                    He stopped moving and listened to the room. Silence...and then a new, familiar feeling. A vibration in the air, some sort of rhythm. He noticed a dancing little thought appear through the back of his eyelids. Behind that thought was another small one, romping in the ether, with its hands on the one in front of it. The conga line had begun. He smiled and was blissfully asleep within minutes, never remembering the darkness, never remembering the dank bower that knew of no better days.

                    Every morning, an arc of the neck, to see them go. The angle of the kitchen window, and the way the blind hung, made him lean forward over the sink, to see them go. In his mind he would follow them down the sidewalk for as long as he could, for as long as he could reconstruct it. Wisteria batted the window and water boiled, creating a pang in his heart he covered up with cheap caffeine and buttered croissants. This all seemed to be a whispered pattern he’d spent nearly thirty years trying to figure out. 
                    <br>
                    Every morning they left, but they came back, they always came back—“Thank god!” he thought. He had no interest in living the day where he didn’t have the opportunity to greet them at the front like a happy dog. 
                    <br>
                    “I will take it for granted when I’m dead”, he thought to himself, as he took a swig from his coffee and tried to forget the pain in his neck so he could do it again the next morning.

Carrot greens poking out of the bag under my armpit. I smiled at the sun today. Not something doctor approved or recommended, but I will do it again because it felt nice. It delivered me warm regards in the form of a sneeze and sent me on my merry way with little floating orbs in my vision—child photons incubating in my eye sockets. 
                    <br>
                    The ice cream had melted by the time I got home, I didn’t care. I smiled at the sun today. It felt warm.

                <h2>Sodium Smokescreen</h2>
                <p>
                    Nic O’Carrol had grown beans for the last 10 years in long, snaking rows all over the family land. Since the last war, nearly everyone had struggled to restart, everyone except Nic. Lucky for him, his mother had enjoyed experimenting with plants almost as much as she enjoyed being out in the field sticking them into the ground. He was sure this was in response to her mother, desperately trying to prove that she wouldn’t lose the land due to failing soil health. Regardless of the reason, Nic’s mother had built up an incredible seed bank in their cellar with old and new drought-resistant varieties that weren’t susceptible to the new strains ruining his neighbors’ crops. 
                    <br>
                    Nic’s father, on the other hand, had gone off to war, quite proudly, to prove he could shuffle troops and kill efficiently. He quickly did quite the opposite by getting sent to a military prison after sending an entire regiment across a mine field with divining rods made from saplings. He was as evangelical as they come and was convinced, as his father had been, and his father’s father, all the way back to the frontier time, that God sat at the end of anything fresh and green—as long as you believed hard enough. Most of his family had used the same method for finding water for wells, so how could finding explosives be any different...his father wondered while rotting in some cell far-off. 
                    <br>
                    Nic thought about his distant and deceased family as he grabbed his trusty sawed-off shotgun filled with rock salt that was leaning against the back door. Since the war, and the following recession, new lovers, eager to prove a little bombing and gunfire couldn’t rob them of their youth, sought haylofts, instead of pricey inns and hotels, to wrap their legs in knots around each other under the wooden roofs of barns. Nic owned one of these barns and had become tuned to a specific creaking at certain hours of the night.
                    <br>
                    He had the routine of loudly walking and clicking while investigating, hoping to disrupt any tryst before he was too close. Tonight, he stopped halfway to the barn, deep in thought. Eventually, the barn door slid open and two bodies slipped into the night. Nic smiled and aimed his gun into the sky. As he pulled the trigger and emptied the cartridges, he thought, surely I must be trying to prove something to the world, to myself. Surely.
                    <br>
                    The gun powder and tang in the air made him think of his mother shooting at gophers. He so badly wanted to see her again. He walked up to the barn door and decided to head in. He climbed up the ladder and laid down in the fresh cradle-shape made in the hay by the latest guests. It was still warm and he felt sleep begin to overtake him. He placed the shotgun to the side, feeling safe and protected by the curved bodies of the boards making up the inside wall of the barn. The last thing he remembered was seeing two knots in the beam above him, sunken and ever-watching as his grandfather’s eyes. 
                    <br>
                    In the cold and dewy morning, Nic descended from the hayloft and out into the field holding two bits of bent wire. In the crisp air he allowed the wire to turn and twist in his calloused hands. He was going to divine water and dig a well, that would be a start toward proving something, he was sure of it.

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>
                    Mary sipped morning coffee and opened her bedroom window. Prudence, her companion, smelled of verdigris—if that even had a smell. The dipping canyon her back window overlooked hinted at a transition of waking. Chirps, creaks, and drips made their way up and around her room. Prudence was in a good mood this morning, she could tell. On many occasions, she refused to make herself known to the world by hiding under covers,  in dark corners, and inside books. Today, however, Prudence seemed almost an electric buzz of tacit force, swimming in energetic thought. Mary, nose deep in her mug, kept quiet knowing that days like today were special, and to speak would ruin the rhythm of the fun morning. Prisms of light, coming from a triangular piece of glass given to her by her father, spit split colors from floor to ceiling, giving Mary an afflatus similar to what Prudence must be currently channeling. The room became a whole world of its own, a happy mix of bird chatter and aromatic beams. 
                    <br>
                    Prudence continued her frenetic movement around the room, eventually floating over to Mary to whisper a “good morning my love” into her ear. Then, to her astonishment, Prudence floated through her and out the window, joining the concert of activity in the canyon. She watched as she drifted and danced through sycamores, eventually disappearing into the rising sun. Mary took another sip of her coffee and a deep breath of the fragrant air. The day ahead looked bright, as her invented god had ventured out once again in a prescient trance, meaning that she too would soon dance under deciduous trees. Just as soon as she finished her coffee.

                    We love to say, “The first one through the door gets shot.” However, we live in a world where not only the first one, but the second one, and the third one, and the fourth...the ones hiding under desks and behind bookcases, the ones pleading with reason, those who look and sound different than the assailant, or those just in the wrong place at the wrong time—even the gun holder gets shot, sometimes by himself. KAMBLAM! Faster than you can say “ABC”.

                <h2>Ripe Fruit, Old Minds</h2>
                <p>
                    They did not buy the house because of its architecture, or layout, or square-footage, or location—but rather because of the small, concave dip in the front yard. At its base grew a gnarled, stout crabapple tree overburdened with ripe little orbs. 
                    <br>
                    He could barely believe it the first time he laid his eyes on it while bringing the car to a halt at the end of the gravel drive—was it the same tree from his childhood? After telling his wife of forty years he would meet her inside, he slowly edged down the decline, into the earthy bowl, as if approaching a wild stallion. He brought his hand up to the mangled bark and traced the nearly-fossilized shapes down to its base. Allowing his cane to drop, he fell to his knees and grabbed one of its fallen gifts off the ground. This was the same tree, he was sure of it. But, how could it have come here, halfway around the earth? He brought the crabapple to his mouth and took a bitter bite that transported him to his childhood, to the grove behind the old cider mill. A mealy nostalgia took hold of him as he sat down heavily on its roots. He eventually lifted his gaze to see his wife running from the front of the house towards him, so sure this was the heart attack she’d mentally prepared for so many times before falling asleep next to him. 
                    <br>
                    “Please god—not today!”
                    <br>
                    He calmly picked himself up and met her halfway up the dip, without his cane. He gave a loving laugh, assuring her he was fine, and told her it was just this tree that had such an affect on him.
                    <br>
                    “We must buy this place. We must!”
                    <br>
                    He began gushing with stories, and plans for the front yard, and different recipes they could use with all the crabapples. He hadn’t been this talkative in years, and by the time they got home his wife almost wished that his heart had finally failed. But she instantly laughed off such an insane thought as she dusted off her old baking books in the study. She was too in love with him, and seeing him act like a child again was a joy. Besides, it was a nice yard, and someone really should eat all that fallen fruit anyways.

                <h2>Pig in a Blanket</h2>
                <p>
                    With second degree burns from brushing elbows and a sore throat from small talk, Professor Scuttleburt fell onto a fresh bed with sheets pulled tight like a trampoline. He bounced on impact and thought, between up-and-downs, of the chitter-chatter and cocktail weenies he had partaken in at his colleague’s, Dr. Albright, upscale apartment. Everyone was working on new books, stories, papers and editorials, and spoke of them all with a heated passion around a dying, philistine fire craving the oxygen being sucked into intellectual lungs. He found himself quickly second-guessing flying out to Chicago for the conference. 
                    <br>
                    Dr. Scuttleburt, or Professor Mark in the presence of friends, family, or exemplar students (they knew who they were), squirmed to kick off his khakis and pull off his starchy dress shirt. He felt up his gut for a minute, impressed by its girth...at least the cocktail weenies stuck around, unlike the conversation. He pulled his laptop off the side table and opened up the educational portal in the browser. He had a sudden urge to see what was going on in the minds of his nascent writers. 
                    <br>
                    He was regretful within the first minute—‘befuddled’, what Thesaurus did they beat up to get that one?
                    <br>
                    He slammed the laptop shut. 
                    <br>
                    “Dribble drivel—all of it,” he muttered as he  wormed around to slip under the taut covers. 
                    <br>
                    The pressure made him feel secure, but also gave him discomfort in the abdomen region. Those little piggies were making quite the gurgling ruckus down below. He twisted and turned to help ease the growing pain, but almost yelped when he found himself on his stomach. He was pinned down by the sheets; he felt as if a giant rubber band was reaching around the bed and snapping him against the mattress from behind. 
                    <br>
                    The pain was now too intense to flip. He feverishly gripped the headrest bars, pushing and pulling rapidly to try and shake the linen chains off him. He realized it was no use, he was THE victim of an aggressive turndown service. 
                    <br>
                    He was red and hot from the movement, and had cooked up a steaming anger toward the hotel staff. He would surely complain tomorrow, after consuming his continental breakfast.

                    It rises up within but I do not know what it is. It burns my insides and tenses my throat. 
                    But, it is good...right? Maybe it’s my youth making itself known before it is forgotten or my myopic view imploding. 
                    Whatever it is, the sweet runoff is welcome and the necrotizing of faithless tissue celebrated.
                    <br> 
                    Here it comes again, this tide. I can see it coming. I will rise with it and jump on a ship and sail out. 
                    It’s beautiful, it’s painful, I will realize most of it too late—but I will hop on the helm and spin my wheel in ecstasy. 
                    <br>
                    “Look at the break in the clouds on the horizon!” I will turn to a crew-less deck, gaze past the mast and see hands waving at me from the shore. 
                    So excited by my departure, I’d forgotten I was alone on the vessel. I guess I understand this rising now, the moment I float out into a dreamless sleep, captain of nothing. 
                    <br>
                    Finally.

                    He ran to the front, nearly ripping the gate off its hinges, eager to get at his love. 
                    He insisted on having her jump on so he could piggyback her over the Fall puddles on the walkway back to the house. 
                    When they burst through the front door, it was clear they were a completely intertwined, well-oiled, organic machine; her, a prized passenger gripping his willing neck and shoulders. 
                    Everyone inside smiled through jealousy, and there wasn’t a hand in the house that didn’t pat on an empty seat, hungry for the glowing couple to come splash fermented residual moon honey on their lonely sides. 
                    <br>
                    To be carried like that, even as a sack of potatoes, would be nice every once in a while.

                    <br>
                    “And when god is out of the office, your partner leaves you, your family abandons you—or was never there at all—who will write the checks?”
                    <br>
                    The hot yoga studio was perfect for his rabid speeches as he could turn the heat up to make everyone glisten under his words. 
                    Men and women pulled out their wallets and purses to kiss them lovingly. 
                    Any children stood at the edges of the room and watched their parents sweat on unused mats. 
                    <br>
                    The preacher smacked his lips and prepared himself for the figurative cherry to his rehearsed speech. 
                    The crisp hundred dollar bill was slipped out of his back pocket, help up like an offering, and then applied to his forehead in rapid dabbing motions. 
                    <br>
                    “Ah—now this I can use! This can heal and sustain me! THIS PAYS THE BILLS. Repeat after me, THIS PAYS THE BILLS!”
                    <br>
                    The crowd lurched towards the front, mouths gaping in unison. 
                    They couldn’t repeat it fast enough. Their children would eventually learn, and understand, and use their own money to PAY THE GODDAMN BILLS!

                    The silver heron cuts its wings over a lake named after its own color. 
                    The tips of its primaries slice water like melted butter. 
                    It is taking in the deliciousness of the morning, the fish always forget the danger of stillness; 
                    their little fishy brains slowly digest away as the heron strikes at the distant evergreen tops. 
                    Thermal lifts and warms, powering the aviator to another lake of a different name. 
                    The sorcery in these columns will never be known to those who cannot harness the wind, for it has seen the little bulging eyes looking up, landlocked, in wonderment at its blurred streaks. 
                    Look quick and don’t get sliced by the silver, this pointed beak is seeking another spot to wade and tarry, and be still once again.

                During the peak of a storm, he would kick his slippers off and waltz into the storm to dance and croon for his beautiful wife. 
                She would tilt her head back, fake swooning, and wonder how she got so lucky. 
                Such a silly man dancing in the rain, lit by distant lightning. 
                Occasionally, she would stand up and check on the wash and stick her hand out, seeking his.
