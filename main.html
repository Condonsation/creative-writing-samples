                <h2>Pig in a Blanket</h2>
                <p>
                    With second degree burns from brushing elbows and a sore throat from small talk, Professor Scuttleburt fell onto a fresh bed with sheets pulled tight like a trampoline. He bounced on impact and thought, between up-and-downs, of the chitter-chatter and cocktail weenies he had partaken in at his colleague’s, Dr. Albright, upscale apartment. Everyone was working on new books, stories, papers and editorials, and spoke of them all with a heated passion around a dying, philistine fire craving the oxygen being sucked into intellectual lungs. He found himself quickly second-guessing flying out to Chicago for the conference. 
                    <br>
                    Dr. Scuttleburt, or Professor Mark in the presence of friends, family, or exemplar students (they knew who they were), squirmed to kick off his khakis and pull off his starchy dress shirt. He felt up his gut for a minute, impressed by its girth...at least the cocktail weenies stuck around, unlike the conversation. He pulled his laptop off the side table and opened up the educational portal in the browser. He had a sudden urge to see what was going on in the minds of his nascent writers. 
                    <br>
                    He was regretful within the first minute—‘befuddled’, what Thesaurus did they beat up to get that one?
                    <br>
                    He slammed the laptop shut. 
                    <br>
                    “Dribble drivel—all of it,” he muttered as he  wormed around to slip under the taut covers. 
                    <br>
                    The pressure made him feel secure, but also gave him discomfort in the abdomen region. Those little piggies were making quite the gurgling ruckus down below. He twisted and turned to help ease the growing pain, but almost yelped when he found himself on his stomach. He was pinned down by the sheets; he felt as if a giant rubber band was reaching around the bed and snapping him against the mattress from behind. 
                    <br>
                    The pain was now too intense to flip. He feverishly gripped the headrest bars, pushing and pulling rapidly to try and shake the linen chains off him. He realized it was no use, he was THE victim of an aggressive turndown service. 
                    <br>
                    He was red and hot from the movement, and had cooked up a steaming anger toward the hotel staff. He would surely complain tomorrow, after consuming his continental breakfast.

                <h2>The Tide Drowns All Who Can no Longer Swim</h2>
                <p>
                    It rises up within but I do not know what it is. It burns my insides and tenses my throat. 
                    But, it is good...right? Maybe it’s my youth making itself known before it is forgotten or my myopic view imploding. 
                    Whatever it is, the sweet runoff is welcome and the necrotizing of faithless tissue celebrated.
                    <br> 
                    Here it comes again, this tide. I can see it coming. I will rise with it and jump on a ship and sail out. 
                    It’s beautiful, it’s painful, I will realize most of it too late—but I will hop on the helm and spin my wheel in ecstasy. 
                    <br>
                    “Look at the break in the clouds on the horizon!” I will turn to a crew-less deck, gaze past the mast and see hands waving at me from the shore. 
                    So excited by my departure, I’d forgotten I was alone on the vessel. I guess I understand this rising now, the moment I float out into a dreamless sleep, captain of nothing. 
                    <br>
                    Finally.

                <h2>Hitched Upright Elixir </h2>
                <p>
                    He ran to the front, nearly ripping the gate off its hinges, eager to get at his love. 
                    He insisted on having her jump on so he could piggyback her over the Fall puddles on the walkway back to the house. 
                    When they burst through the front door, it was clear they were a completely intertwined, well-oiled, organic machine; her, a prized passenger gripping his willing neck and shoulders. 
                    Everyone inside smiled through jealousy, and there wasn’t a hand in the house that didn’t pat on an empty seat, hungry for the glowing couple to come splash fermented residual moon honey on their lonely sides. 
                    <br>
                    To be carried like that, even as a sack of potatoes, would be nice every once in a while.

                <h2>A Capitalistic Sermon</h2>
                <p>
                    “Repeat after me, BUT IT DOESN’T PAY THE BILLS!”
                    <br>
                    “BUT IT DOESN’T PAY THE BILLS!”
                    <br>
                    “Again!—“
                    <br>
                    The preacher had them, they were in a fervor. 
                    <br>
                    “And when god is out of the office, your partner leaves you, your family abandons you—or was never there at all—who will write the checks?”
                    <br>
                    The hot yoga studio was perfect for his rabid speeches as he could turn the heat up to make everyone glisten under his words. 
                    Men and women pulled out their wallets and purses to kiss them lovingly. 
                    Any children stood at the edges of the room and watched their parents sweat on unused mats. 
                    <br>
                    The preacher smacked his lips and prepared himself for the figurative cherry to his rehearsed speech. 
                    The crisp hundred dollar bill was slipped out of his back pocket, help up like an offering, and then applied to his forehead in rapid dabbing motions. 
                    <br>
                    “Ah—now this I can use! This can heal and sustain me! THIS PAYS THE BILLS. Repeat after me, THIS PAYS THE BILLS!”
                    <br>
                    The crowd lurched towards the front, mouths gaping in unison. 
                    They couldn’t repeat it fast enough. Their children would eventually learn, and understand, and use their own money to PAY THE GODDAMN BILLS!

                <h2>Danger Lurks in Stillness</h2>
                <p>
                    The silver heron cuts its wings over a lake named after its own color. 
                    The tips of its primaries slice water like melted butter. 
                    It is taking in the deliciousness of the morning, the fish always forget the danger of stillness; 
                    their little fishy brains slowly digest away as the heron strikes at the distant evergreen tops. 
                    Thermal lifts and warms, powering the aviator to another lake of a different name. 
                    The sorcery in these columns will never be known to those who cannot harness the wind, for it has seen the little bulging eyes looking up, landlocked, in wonderment at its blurred streaks. 
                    Look quick and don’t get sliced by the silver, this pointed beak is seeking another spot to wade and tarry, and be still once again.

                    Pouring water from a glass, that’s how easy it is for you to exist in the current of this life. 
                    <br>
                    For me, and others, it is like squeezing a lemon rind. It burns the eyes and mouth. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taking a deep breath of the lavender air, that’s how easy it is for you. 
                    <br>
                    For me, the air is too thin. Each small intake burns worse than the acidity of the citric skins. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For you, love rolls off your body and your mind. It is intoxicating to watch from your banks. 
                    <br>
                    For us, it is like squeezing blood from a stone. Have you ever tried to squeeze blood from a stone before? 
                    <br>
                    Of course you have—it is like pouring water to you. 
                    <br>
                    We have no choice but to cast our stones and fall headfirst into your rushing streams. </p>

                    We are all trying, so desperately, to keep each other company in some way. 
                    A phone call, a marriage, a note, a gift, a thought...knowing if they did it for us, we would feel alive—cherished! 
                    To see and feel, even an elbow bump or a glance at a bar, builds up a sustaining force inside of us, so we can continue finding others, even if it is ourselves. 
                    <br>
                    Who can we keep company today? 
                    <br>
                    Oh—what beautiful eyes those are looking at me! I haven’t seen that color before.

            <p>
                She, 87, he, 85. They would open their garage door slightly during monsoon season to hear the pitter-patter and enjoy a reprieve from the piercing Arizona heat. 
                During the peak of a storm, he would kick his slippers off and waltz into the storm to dance and croon for his beautiful wife. 
                She would tilt her head back, fake swooning, and wonder how she got so lucky. 
                Such a silly man dancing in the rain, lit by distant lightning. 
                Occasionally, she would stand up and check on the wash and stick her hand out, seeking his. 
                Obligingly, he would do his little dance to her and rip her out into the sheet of water. 
                She would kick off her slippers and begin dancing, silly as well, under the hidden moon. 
                <br>
                “Twist and sing, just like this old man?” She would ask with a wink. 
                <br>
                “You and I can dance just the same.” He would say. 
                <br>
                “I would want it no other way. Let us, until we are washed away.” She would say. 
                <br>
                He would say nothing, just watch his love dance...dancing under the spiraling sky. 
                <br>
                Let us dance forever on this driveway, he would hope.
